Currently in active re-writing process from scratch with better more efficient code-base
and SQL-code as 'SM Stats' (renamed from XStats) with full extended translation support.
The new code is more efficient and impacts less on server performance.

Games supported so far:
Team Fortress 2 (works great so far, potential bugs)
Counter-Strike: Source (buggy)

Some functions yet implemented and sooner or later will be.
Some things may not work as intended at the very moment, but will get working sooner or later.

[Geoip Country Name Translation](https://github.com/Teamkiller324/SM-Geoip-CountryName) - Required for country name translation and compiling, aswell as for plugin to function.

``SM Stats`` or ``SourceMod Stats`` is a multi-statistical tracking plugin that tracks frags, events, achievements and offers multi-game support, player connection/disconnection messages, player connect sounds, full translation support and more likely to come.

### This project is just a hobby and is in no way made to compete with HLStatsX:CE nor gameME.
