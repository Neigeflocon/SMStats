# Xstats
Xstats is a multi-statistics tracking plugin, featuring kill tracking, achievement tracking and more to come.

Influenced by gameMe (formerly named HLStats), HLStatsX:CE (Community driven HLStatsX version) 

This will a 'plug-n-play' type of plugin. Throw the plugin into the server, add the neccessary database.cfg lines to connect to the database and You're done.

At the moment there is no web panel yet but if you're interested in helping out on that part, hit me up https://steamcommunity.com/id/Teamkiller324

Development: soon to be test-able.

Currently supporting only Team Fortress 2 but will ofcourse later support other games.

The plugin is split in different parts to make updating more effective, rather than updating one single package.
Such as:

Xstats: Core (The main plugin itself)

Xstats: Libraries (Library holding such as weapon names)

Xstats: Connect (Connect & disconnect messages module)

Xstats: game name (The game module)

Xstats: Killstreaks (Awarding points for killstreaks, will be worked on.)

Xstats: Achievements (Custom achievements module)

This will be updated to a nicer design later and better description.
