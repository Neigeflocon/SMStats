## xStats
``Currently being re-built from scratch with a huge optimization. (All-in-one and Updater support.) At the moment in early development stages.``

xStats is a multi-statistics tracking plugin, featuring kill tracking, achievement tracking and more to come.

xStats is not made to superceed any statistical plugins, it's just made for fun and improving skills.

### Influenced by gameMe & HLStatsX:CE (Community driven HLStatsX version) 

This is a 'plug-n-play' type of plugin. Throw the plugin into the server, add the neccessary database.cfg lines to connect to the database and You're done.

## Requirements
### [Tklib](https://github.com/Teamkiler324) (To compile.)

### [Updater](https://github.com/Teamkiller324/Updater)

### [SteamWorks](http://users.alliedmods.net/~kyles/builds/SteamWorks/) (due to Updater.)

### ``Event Manager`` (Will be uploaded later.)

## Games supported. (So far)

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
Counter-Strike: Source
Team Fortress 2 (Work in progress.)
