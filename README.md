Currently in active re-writing process from scratch with better code-base and much more efficient SQL code as ``SM Stats`` with full extended translation support.
The new code is more efficient and impacts less on server performance.

```
Games supported so far:
Team Fortress 2
```

[Geoip Country Name Translation](https://github.com/Teamkiller324/SM-Geoip-CountryName) - Required for country name translation and compiling.

``SM Stats`` or ``SourceMod Stats`` is a multi-statistical tracking plugin that tracks frags, events, achievements and offers multi-game support, player connection/disconnection messages, player connect sounds, full translation support and more likely to come.

### This project is just a hobby and is in no way made to compete with HLStatsX:CE nor gameME.

## GitHub page to be updated.
