# xStats - Currently being re-built from scratch with a huge optimization. (All-in-one and Updater support.)
xStats is a multi-statistics tracking plugin, featuring kill tracking, achievement tracking and more to come.

xStats is not made to superceed any statistical plugins, it's just made for fun and improving skills.

Influenced by gameMe, HLStatsX:CE (Community driven HLStatsX version) 

This is a 'plug-n-play' type of plugin. Throw the plugin into the server, add the neccessary database.cfg lines to connect to the database and You're done.

At the moment there is no web panel yet but if you're interested in helping out on that part, hit me up https://steamcommunity.com/id/Teamkiller324

This will be updated to a nicer design later and better description later on.
