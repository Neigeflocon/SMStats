# Xstats
Xstats is a multi-statistics tracking plugin, featuring kill tracking, achievement tracking and more to come.

Influenced by gameMe (formerly named HLStats), HLStatsX:CE (Community driven HLStatsX version) 

Development: soon to be test-able.

Currently supporting only Team Fortress 2 but will ofcourse later support other games.

The plugin is split in different parts to make updating more effective, rather than updating one single package.
Such as:

Xstats: Core (The main plugin itself)

Xstats: Libraries (Library holding such as weapon names)

Xstats: Connect (Connect & disconnect messages module)

Xstats: <game name> (The game module)
